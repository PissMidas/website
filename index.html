    <h1>PissMidas</h1>
    <p>This is the official homepage of the Awakening Overlay Uploader App.</p>
    <p>This app is for tournament stream runners to display awakenings for the game Omega Strikers. The app reads data from .log files generated from the game. Then it processes it and uploads that data to a google spreadsheet. Users can use that data spreadsheet to generate a graphic overlay, and have that overlay be broadcasted on their tournament stream.</p>
