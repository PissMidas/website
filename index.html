    <h1>PissMidas</h1>
    <p>This is the official homepage of the Awakening Overlay Uploader App.</p>
    <p>This app is for tournament stream runners to display awakenings for the game Omega Strikers. The app reads data from .log files generated locally on your PC which the game generates. The app processes those game events and uploads that data to a google sheet. Users can then use the sheet to generate a graphic overlay, and have that overlay be broadcasted on their tournament stream.</p>
